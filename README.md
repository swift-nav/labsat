## Usage

Run the `help` command:
```
λ: runCtx $ runStatsCtx $ testCommand <ip address> <port> $ help
HelpCommands ["HELP","TYPE","FIND","MON","PLAY","REC","ATTN","CONF","MEDIA","MUTE"]
```

Run the `info` command:
```
λ: runCtx $ runStatsCtx $ testCommand <ip address> <port> $ info
Info ["Labsat Wideband","Serial 57082 ","Firmware 1.0.260","FPGA 33","IP 10.1.22.44","Battery not connected","TCXO-0x7b7f"]
```

Run the play command, check status, stop playing, check status:
```
λ: runCtx $ runStatsCtx $ testCommand  <ip address> <port> $ play "File_001"
"File_001"

λ: runCtx $ runStatsCtx $ testCommand  <ip address> <port> $ playStatus
Playing "File_001" "00:00:03"

λ: runCtx $ runStatsCtx $ testCommand  <ip address> <port> $ playStop
"OK"

λ: runCtx $ runStatsCtx $ testCommand  <ip address> <port> $ playStatus
PlayIdle
```


## Development

`labsat` has a shakefile/makefile to provide convenience around building and testing:

    # build the project's libraries, executables, and tests
    $ ./Shakefile.hs build-tests-error

    # test the project
    $ ./Shakefile.hs tests-error

    # start an interpreter with the project's libraries, executables, and tests loaded
    $ ./Shakefile.hs ghci-tests

    # install the project's executables
    $ ./Shakefile.hs install

    # clean the project
    $ ./Shakefile.hs clean

    # lint the project source code
    $ ./Shakefile.hs lint
